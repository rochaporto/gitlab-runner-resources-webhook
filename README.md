# Gitlab Runner Resources Webhook

This project should not be required and is a workaround to [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/3464). You might want to also monitor [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/merge_requests/1526), once it's merged this repo is pointless.

It was also a good exercise to learn more about writing Admission Webhooks.
